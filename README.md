# Introduction

I created this simple webpage using HTML5, CSS, JS using Fetch API in order to get the names of the Lord of The Rings books

## Making the Website

I decided to create a simple API webpage in order to familiarize myself. I found a LOTR Api which stored simple information such as the LOTR book names.

I added the pictures + styles to improve the overall look of the webpage.
